## What is Startalk-docker?
Startalk is an open source IM platform. It supports all the platforms and OSs you can think of, excellent performance.
Its performance and stability have been proved in Qunar's production during the last ten years.
For more details about Startalk, see: [Startalk Introduction](https://github.com/startalkIM/Startalk/blob/master/README-en.md)  

Although it is very versatile, it's a huge system. We hope the deployement could be more accessible for people who want to try it so that we containerize each module into Docker. Within Docker, it take less than 5 minutes to start it up.

As for usage in production enviroment, the origin way of deployment is more recommended. We have thorough introduction to tell you how to deploy Startalk on CentOS / Ubuntu step by step, even newbie can complete the deployment within a few hours.


## How to get started?
1. Make sure you have docker installed in your system. It is best recommended under
  * Docker version 20.10.0
  * Docker-compose version 1.27.4
  * Dockerfile version 3
  

2. ```git clone https://github.com/startalkIM/startalk-docker-compose.git && cd startalk-docker-compose```  
  It contains only docker compose.  

3. ```./startalkdockerctl init```  
  **WARNING: For users in Windows, if you don't have sed command installed on your PC, we recommend install Git Bash (https://gitforwindows.org/) and then execute this script.**  
  This script use sed command to correct IP in config files so that Startalk clients can reach the server. It also supports clean up the data and start docker-compose. See ```./startalkdockerctl help```. 

4. ```./startalkdockerctl start```  
  This equals docker-compose -d, it starts Startalk in background. 

5. Use PC client connect to the startalk-docker via navigation: http://${ip_you_provide}:8080/newapi/nck/qtalk_nav.qunar  
  Download PC client from our website: [Download Page](https://i.startalk.im/home/#/download)
